\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Observing cetaceans (whales and dolphins) in their natural habitat, by
either observing directly from the coast or going into the open ocean,
is a recreational activity that is quickly gaining popularity and
becoming a booming touristic industry, in what is known as whale
watching {[}1{]}.

The practice originated in the United States during the early fifties
with the observation of the migratory behavior of grey whales near the
Cabrillo National Monument area in San Diego and spread throughout the
Pacific coast of the US. In the Atlantic coast, the Montreal Zoological
Society started the practice in the early seventies organizing beluga
whale observation trips in the St.~Lawrence River. By 1985, whale
watching had grown more popular in the Atlantic coast of the US
surpassing the number of watchers in the opposing coast of the country.
This difference in growth speed of the industry has been attributed to
both the local population of humpback whales (\emph{Megaptera
novaeangliae}) and the presence of large cities in the region {[}1{]}.

In 1992, the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society (WDCS) carried out
the first global whale watching survey, conducted by Erich Hoyt. An
updated version was submitted by the United Kingdom to the International
Whaling Commission (IWC) during 1995, in a demonstration of the
economical-touristic value of cetacean conservation {[}2{]}.

Cetaceans themselves are large marine mammals, diverging from even-toed
ungulates (Artiodactyla) during the Paleogene, with their closest living
land-dwelling being hippos. Cetaceans are split around 34 million years
ago into two parvorders {[}3{]}, as shown in figure \ref{fig:tree01}.

Mysticeti, also known as baleen whales, which is comprised of 15 extant
species distributed into the families \emph{Balaenidae} (right and
bowhead whales), \emph{Balaenopteridae} (rorquals),
\emph{Cetotheriidae/Neobalaenidae} (pygmy right whale), and
\emph{Eschrichtiidae} (gray whale). The most notable species within the
parvorder is perhaps the blue whale (\emph{Balaenoptera musculus}),
which has the honor of being the largest animal known to have ever
existed.

The second parvorder of cetaceans is the Odontoceti, toothed whales,
comprised of several families grouped into the superfamilies,
Delphinoidea (doplhins and relatives), Inioidea, Platanistoidea,
Lipotoidea (all river dolphins), Physeteroidea (sperm whales) and
Ziphioidea (beaked whales). Within these superfamilies the most notable
species are, the sperm whale (\emph{Physeter macrocephalus}), the common
bottlenose dolphin (\emph{Tursiops truncatus}) and the orca
(\emph{Orcinus orca}), shown in figure \ref{fig:photo_orca}. The
popularity of these species is most likely due to the effect of
literature and television shows and movies, specially Moby-Dick (a novel
by Herman Melville, 1851), Flipper (a MGM television show, 1964) and
Free Willy (a Warner Bros.~movie, 1993), respectively.

\section{Methods}\label{methods}}

Recorded data of human sightings of all described cetacean species in
the delphinidae family corresponding to the period of 2010 to 2019 was
recollected from the Blobal Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF).

This data was analyzed considering the species, genus, location and time
of each observation, and used to establish a global map of delphinidae
sightings during this last decade, to identify popular locations for
whale watching and to make predictions for the immediate future
regarding the expected number of sightings for the \emph{Orcinus orca}
species.

Human wildlife observations registered at GBIF from the start of 2010 to
2019/10/9, have produced 41956 observations of members of the
\emph{Delphinidae} family, registering global ocurrence data for 40
species, between 18 genera (Table \ref{table:species}).

with the highest biodiversity was the United States of America, with 13
different species sighted during the period. Only 14 countries had more
than 5 different species observed during the period (Table

biodiversity, at only 1 species with stable sightings.

Of the recorded species, perhaps none has had such a dramatic shift in
public perception as \emph{Orcinus orca}, initially considered dangerous
savage animals and even pests, whose populations were often actively
killed by both fishermen and governments due to their impact in fishing
and whaling activities. Even their name points to a sinister origin,
considering its common name of killer whale, and that \emph{orcinus}
from latin meaning, belonging to Orcus, the roman god of the
netherworld. Society's opinion on the animals began to change during the
late sixties, with the live capture of Moby Doll, and Bigg's researching
their complex social structures and the actual numbers of their heavily
reduced populations due to extensive ``hunting''. Unlike the most common
popular species, like \emph{Tursiops truncatus}, with 1530 yearly
sightings, orcas only average 209 sightings. Countries with the highest
stable sighting data for \emph{Orcinus orca} have had their yearly
recordings analyzed in figure \ref{fig:orca_country}.

Using yearly sighting data obtained during this decade 3 predictive
models were constructed (Table \ref{table:model_fits}). Utilizing the
best fitted model predictions were made for the last 3 years and until
2022, regarding the expected orca sightings, per month for each of the
countries considered for the model (Figure \ref{fig:plot_model_pred}).

\hypertarget{discussion}{%
\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

It is interesting to note that, as shown in
fig.\ref{fig:plot_model_pred}, most sightings tend to occur during the
summer months, so perhaps the quantity of recorded sightings, on a
specific month, might not be representative of the migratory behaviour
of these animals, and instead be dependant on the number of people
capable of taking such recordings and submitting them, a number that
would be expected to increase during summer vacations, explaining the
results.

Additionally, it is important to mention an outlier that had to be
excluded from the model, despite having some of the largest amount
records, 567 to be exact recorded during the 2010 to 2019 period,
however 563 observations up to 2013, only averaging 0.6 sightings per
year during the rest of the period, the reasons for this sudden
dissapearence of the species from the French Southern Territories is not
apparent, and would require further research to better understand it.

Finally, according to predicted data, the best month to observe orcas in
the wild is July, and the best location would be in the US, specifically
in Alaska.
